# Quantum Firmware Optimization Project

## Overview

The Quantum Firmware Optimization Project aims to optimize the performance of quantum firmware by dynamically allocating resources between classical and hybrid quantum processing. This project leverages TensorFlow Quantum and integrates hardware detection and assessment mechanisms to achieve efficient and optimized processing tailored to the specific requirements of various tasks.

```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum_firmware_optimization.git
   cd quantum_firmware_optimization
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the machine learning model, run the `train_model.py` script:
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py --data_path data/hardware_specs.csv --model_path models/model.h5
```

### Evaluating the Model

To evaluate the trained model, run the `evaluate_model.py` script:
```bash
python scripts/evaluate_model.py --model_path models/model.h5 --data_path data/hardware_specs.csv
```

### Main Workflow

To run the main workflow, which includes hardware detection, resource allocation, and hybrid processing, use the `main.py` script:
```bash
python src/main.py --task_description "Optimize the portfolio using quantum methods" --data path/to/data --circuit path/to/circuit --parameters path/to/parameters --model path/to/model
```
